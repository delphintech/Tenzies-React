// TENZI TOWER: Instead of putting your successfully rolled dice aside, stack them one on top of the other. First player to get all ten of their dice stacked and shout “TENZI” wins!

// SPLITZI: Instead of trying to get all ten dice of one number, try to get five dice of one number and five dice of another number, and then yell “TENZI”.

// TEAM TENZI: Join forces and play in teams! Get all your team’s dice on one number. Or play this way – each team member goes for a different number!

// MEGA TENZI: Ten dice not enough for you? You’ll really have your hands full with twenty dice! Double the challenge, double the frenzy!

// STEALZI: If you see another player roll the number you’re going for, steal those dice and give the player an equal number of your dice. No stealing on the first roll of the game, or from any player going for the same number as you!

// TARGET TENZI: All players declare which number they’re going for before the first roll. Or, decide on one number that everyone has to go for!
